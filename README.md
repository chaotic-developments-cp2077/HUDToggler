# HUDToggler
This Cyberpunk 2077 mod allows for different HUD elements to automatically be shown/hidden when getting in and out of vehicles.

The "real" interface settings do not need to be touched, as they will automatically be toggled depending on whatever is selected in the mod's CET overlay window.

## Disclaimer
This mod uses the [`GameUI.lua`](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-cet-kit/blob/main/GameUI.lua) file by psiberx, which is protected by the MIT license. The `GameSettings.lua` file, however, while having the same name as the one by psiberx, is my own and does not use code from that repo.
